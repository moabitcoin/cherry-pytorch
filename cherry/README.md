## Modular

The core principle of `cherry` is to organise an RL framework around disjoint portable module. These portable modules represent the Agent/Environment coupling presented in [spinning up.](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html#id4) We compose the Agent as its function approximation (Deep NN) representation.
