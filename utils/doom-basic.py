# This script presents how to use the most basic features of the environment.
# It configures the engine, and makes the agent perform random actions.
# It also gets current state and reward earned with the action.
# <episodes> number of episodes are played.
# Random combination of buttons is chosen for every action.
# Game variables from state and last reward are printed.
